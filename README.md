## Interests
- **Data Science**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Artificial Intelligence**

## Education
- Final year **physics** student with a consentration in **system and instrumentation** at **Universitas Indonesia**

## Experience
- **Machine Learning Cohort**: Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka  
  - Selected as one of 4,650 cohorts at Bangkit Academy 2024 batch 1, from over 57,000 applicants.
  - Gained in-depth knowledge of various machine learning concepts, including regression, classification, clustering, recommendation systems, ANN, CNN, deep learning, model deployment, and more.
  - My capstone team was selected as one of the 30 teams eligible to compete in the entrepreneur track, outperforming hundreds of other teams.

## Projects
- **Air Quality-Data Analysis Project**
  - Determined which region in China (among Aotizhongxin, Changping, and Dingling) has high O3 levels while having low SO2, NO2, and CO levels, making it suitable for cultivating kangkung using ozone technology for disinfection and bacterial sterilization.
  - Assessed the optimal harvest cycle for kangkung given a one-month harvest period, with ideal temperatures of 25°C to 30°C and high rainfall, to determine the best month to schedule the harvest.
- **Article Page-Data Analysis Project**
  - Analyzed the characteristics of pages with a high Bounce Rate.
  - Examined among different types of sources/mediums to determine the percentage of pages with good engagement, where a page should have a bounce rate below average, page views per session, and an average time on page above average.
- **Plant Disease Image Classification for Bangkit by google,Goto, and Traveloka**
  -Created a **Plant Disease Image Classification** for my group's application: Tamantic using **Tensorflow** and **Keras**, achieved a training accuracy of 97% and validation accuracy of 92%, which meant that the model is capable to determine the diseases of several plants accurately.
